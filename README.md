And to run the production build:

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js project structure and is a single page website:

- `pages`: Contains the main page of the website
- `components`: Contains reusable React components used throughout the website
- `lib`: Contains utility functions and custom hooks
- `context`: Contains the Context API provider for managing the active header state
- `email`: Contains the email template style component for sending contact form emails
- `public`: Contains static assets like images

## Components

The website is composed of several key components:

- **Header**: Renders the navigation header with dynamic active section highlighting
- **About**: Displays information about my background and skills
- **Projects**: Renders a list of my project cards with descriptions using the `ClientProject` component with animations
- **Skills**: Displays a marquee of my technical skills
- **Experience**: Timeline view of my professional and academic experiences
- **Contact**: Provides a contact form for users to send messages

## Context API

The website uses the Context API for managing the active header state. The `ActiveHeaderContextProvider` component provides the context to the entire application, allowing components to access and update the active header section.

## Styling

The website uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The `tailwind.config.ts` file contains the configuration for Tailwind, including custom styles and animations.
